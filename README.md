About Me:

Hello! I'm Neil Joseph Ranara, a New Era University student pursuing a BSIT. I have some knowledge of basic coding, but not much because I'm more interested in web design, databases, and networking. I like taking on challenging issues and developing sophisticated answers. My career in technology began when I enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology course.
